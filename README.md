On this image, the robots are staying in formation in front of the boat and start to dive.

The aim of this project was to design a controller and a robust observer using [interval analysis](https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/intervalcourse.pdf) for the localization of an underwater robot swarm.

The students had to use the [MOOS middleware](http://www.themoos.org) to make several pieces of software work together, and the [MORSE robot simulator](https://www.openrobots.org/morse/doc/latest/morse.html) to test and validate their algorithm.

My role was to teach the MORSE simulator to the students and help them during the project.
